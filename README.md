# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input.  Specifically, this example showcases a route that retrieves a user by ID, but fails to handle cases where the provided ID is not a valid number.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that attempts to find a user based on the ID provided in the request parameters.  However, it lacks error handling for scenarios where the `userId` is not a number, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs, preventing unexpected behavior and providing informative error responses to the client.
